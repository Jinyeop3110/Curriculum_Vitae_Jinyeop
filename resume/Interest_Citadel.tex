\cvsection{Research Interests}
\begin{cvparagraph}

(1) \textbf{LLM Agent Foundation}: Advancing the technical underpinnings of LLM agents to enhance their intelligence and usefulness. Our ongoing project focuses on developing information-theoretic frameworks to quantify and reinforce the power of LLM agents in an unsupervised setting.

(2) \textbf{Science4AI}: Investigating the underlying physics of LLMs, such as neural scaling laws, which describe how model performance scales with size and data [\ref{Reconcile_Kaplan_Chinchilla}][\ref{Resource_model}], and the in-context learning principle [\ref{ICL}].
