\cvsection{Research Interests}
\begin{cvparagraph}

My core interest is advancing \textbf{technical foundations} for safe and helpful Large Language Model (LLM) agents in the future.

(1) \textbf{Safe and Controllable LLM Agents}: Currently leading a project under MATS 7.0 to develop information-theoretic frameworks for quantifying and constraining \textbf{LLM agents' power}, with particular focus on studying power-seeking behaviors.

(2) \textbf{Neural Scaling Laws}: Investigating fundamental relationships governing LLM performance and scales, with applications to training and inference optimization [\ref{Reconcile_Kaplan_Chinchilla}][\ref{Resource_model}].
