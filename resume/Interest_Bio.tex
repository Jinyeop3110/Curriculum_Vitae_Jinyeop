With a strong expertise in ML, systems biology, and physics, I am interested in:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=0.2em]
  \item \textbf{Protein/Genomic Foundation Models}: developing improved AI foundation models through data acquisition, modeling, and analysis to revolutionize biological research [\ref{MethylGPT}].
  \item \textbf{Interpretability and RL Tuning}: uncovering hidden information structures in bio-AI models and reverse-engineering them with RL [\ref{Protein}].
  \item \textbf{LLM Agents for Biology}: orchestrating LLM-agent pipelines for biological discovery [\ref{Bayesian}].
\end{itemize}
