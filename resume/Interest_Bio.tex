With a strong expertise in ML, systems biology, and physics, I am interested in:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=0.2em]
  \item \textbf{LLM Agents for Drug Discovery}: designing interpretable [\ref{ICL}] and RL-tuned [\ref{KG-R1}] LLM-agent systems to accelerate drug discovery workflows [\ref{Bayesian}, \ref{SPOT}].
  \item \textbf{Protein/Genomic Foundation Models}: building and fine-tuning AI foundation models (e.g., generative models) for biology and medicine (e.g., patient disease prediction or biomolecular representation learning) [\ref{MethylGPT}, \ref{Protein}].
\end{itemize}
