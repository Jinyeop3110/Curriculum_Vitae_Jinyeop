\begin{cvparagraph}


With a strong expertise in \emph{ML} and \emph{Physics}, I am interested in:

(1) \textbf{Multi-LLM Agent RL}: developing practical RL methods to jointly tune multiple models/agents with distinct roles (e.g., \emph{solver} and \emph{validator}), inspired by ecological and evolutionary dynamics.

(2) \textbf{LLM Agent Foundations}: extending my prior work on (1) novel evaluation frameworks for LLM agent~[\ref{EELMA}, \ref{SPOT}], and (2) tool–augmented reasoning with RL~[\ref{KG-R1}].


%(1) \textbf{LLM Agent Foundation}: Advancing the technical underpinnings of LLM agents to enhance their intelligence and usefulness. Our ongoing project focuses on developing information-theoretic frameworks to quantify and reinforce the power of LLM agents in an unsupervised setting.

%(2) \textbf{Science4AI}: Investigating the underlying physics of LLMs, such as neural scaling laws, which describe how model performance scales with size and data [\ref{Reconcile_Kaplan_Chinchilla}][\ref{Resource_model}], and the in-context learning principle [\ref{ICL}].
