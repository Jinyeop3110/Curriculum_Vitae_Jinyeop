\cvsection{Research Interests}
\begin{cvparagraph}


With a strong expertise in \emph{ML} and \emph{Physics}, I am interested in:

(1) \textbf{Science of LLMs}: Investigating the underlying physics and mechanisms of LLMs, including neural scaling laws that describe how model performance scales with size and data~[\ref{Reconcile_Kaplan_Chinchilla}][\ref{Resource_model}], and the principles of in-context learning~[\ref{ICL}].

(2) \textbf{LLM Agent Foundations}: foundational research that guides advanced LLM agents, such as (1) novel evaluation frameworks for LLM agent~[\ref{EELMA}, \ref{SPOT}], and (2) tool–augmented reasoning with RL~[\ref{KG-R1}].
